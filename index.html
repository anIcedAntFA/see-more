        In my opinion and experience, I think the Frontend's responsibilities
        are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensure that website visitors can easily interact with the page
          </li>
          <li>Developing and maintaining the user interface</li>
          <li>Following SEO best practices</li>
          <li>Coordinate with the Design team to create the layout</li>
          <li>
            Coordinate with the Backend team to create functions by REST API
          </li>
          <li>
            Ready to learn, evaluate and apply new technologies to build new
            projects
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        In my recent project, I have done:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Discuss and make decisions with UI/UX designers, research on Shopee,
            Tiki's features, learn how they implement validations and optimize
            user experience
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluate and learn frontend technologies such as React-hook-form &
            Yup for controling and validating form; Recoijs for managing global
            state,...
          </li>
          <li>
            Coordinate with my backend team regarding APIs. I and my colleague
            always communicate about what each other want to receive and send
            back. For examples, send post request with some values of array or
            object, throught body or params... When I have a complex data need
            to be handled in client, I could tell him calculate in server and
            give me back a clear date to easily render.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refactor code like spliting components, fix bugs, merge code and fix
            conflict.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
